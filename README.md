## Branching Strategy
The Branching Strategy that i will use is GitFlow as it is the most widely used branching strategy and is the most simple. <br>
Since i am only a team of one, i dont find it beneficial to use a more complex branching strategy. <br>
One downside to this choice is the fact the GitFlow doesnt allow for multiple versiona of code in production at the same time. <br>
This shouldnt be a problem though becuase there will only be one person working on these projects. <br>

## .gitignore use
.gitignore will be used to tell my local and remote repositories which file types should not be commited along with the rest of the project files <br>
some files that i will be ignoring are those files that are generated by the Operating System or those created automatically by the IDE. <br>

## Storage of Credentials
Security credentials such as tokens and passwords will not be stored on the remote repository as it is susceptible to unwanted access.<br>
Another security measure i will take is the use of the gitignore files i mentioned earlier.
